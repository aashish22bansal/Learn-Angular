<h4>Two-Way-Binding</h4>
<div class="container">
    <p>Suppose we wnat to allow the user to add servers by clicking on the Button below:</p>
    <div class="container">
        <label>Server Name</label>
        <input type="text" class="form-control" (input)="onUpdateServerName($event)">
        <p>{{ serverName }}</p>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="!allowNewServer" (click)="onCreateServer()">Add Server</button>
        <p>{{ ServerCreationStatus }}</p>
    </div>
    <p>But at this point, the button is just a static button is just a static button and it cannot do anything. So, we will add a new property in the TypeScript Code named allowNewServer as a boolean value. (Heading to TypeScript File to create the variable.)</p>
    <p>In the constructor we will define a Timeout() method which will trigger after the specified period of time. In the method body, we will set the allowNewServer to be set to <code>true</code> and then use the <code>disabled</code> HTML attribute within Square Brackets (<code>[]</code>) as <code>[disabled]</code> which would indicate that we are using <b>Property Binding</b> to dynamically bind some property and change it in the DOM for the parsed model and then pass the property name used in the TypeScript class as: <code>[disabled] = "!allowNewServer"</code>. This will exactly resolve to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> based on the property needs.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now, we have already created the Button. Say that we want to output the value of a Property (say we have a Property named ServerCreationStatus in the TypeScript File).</p>
    <p>Now, to listen to events, we can create another method in the TypeScript File (named <code>onCreateServer()</code>). This method will be called by some event(s).</p>
    <p>Now, we know that we want to listen to the click event generated by the Button (for which we have the onClick attribute in HTML as well). Now, in Angular, for Event Binding, we will use the syntax containing Parenthesis (<code>()</code>) and specify the name of the event within the Parenthesis as a <code>click</code> event and mention the code we want to execute within the Double Quotation marks which in our case is the <code>onCreateServer()</code> method.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now, suppose before this button, we also have a <code>label</code> which consists of <code>Server Name</code> and we are allowing the user to provide the name of the server as input in the input field below it which would listen to the event. Now, in the TypeScript File, we want to update the value in the variable to the value which has been provided by the user in the input form. We can pass this value in the event listener in the form of <code>$event</code> which is a <b>Reserved Variable Name</b> for this event. It will represent the data emitted by the event. We will receive this event in the TypeScript File (any will be of type <code>any</code> for now and will be changed to <code>Event</code> when we will be assigning the data to some particular variable(s)).</p>
    <br>
    <p>We can bind to some other data in another way by combining Property Binding and Event Binding using <code>[()]</code> and along with this, we will use a special directive <code>ngModel</code> which we will set to some Property defined in the TypeScript code (for example, <code>serverName</code>) which will trigger on the input event and update the value of <code>serverName</code> in our component automatically and on the other hand, it will also update the value of the input element if we were to change the value of <code>serverName</code> to something else.</p>
