<h1>Components</h1>
<p>Components are important as we start with the <code>AppComponent</code>. It is a normal Angular Component and on the other hand it is also a special because it servers as our <b>root</b> component in the AppModule in the <code>bootstrap</code> array in the <code>app.module.ts</code> file which tells Angular that it is a special component and that we should bootstrap the entire application with that component being the <code>root</code> component. So, all the other components that we create will not be added to the <code>index.html</code> file and their selectors will not be added here as they will be added to the <code>app.component.html</code> file because it is the <code>root</code> component of the app with respect to the other parts.</p>

<h2>Adding Component</h2>
<p>Say, we want to output some information about a server as we are building a backend for a Server Application, so we can store it in a new folder which is the sub folder of the app folder because generally in an Angular CLI Project, all the <code>app</code> related content will be present within the <code>app</code> folder. Suppose the name of the sub-folder is <b><code>Server</code></b> because it holds the Server Component. <u>It is a good practice to have the Folder Name equal to the Component Name and each component should have it's own folder.</u> </p>
<p>Now, while creating the <code>server</code> component, the syntax which we can use is:</p>
<p><code> COMPONENT_NAME.component.ts</code></p>
<p>The file extension for the component is <code>ts</code> which refers to <b>TypeScript</b> in which we will code the component.</p>

<h2>How to create a component</h2>
<p>A Component is simply a TypeScript class so that Angular is able to instantiate it to create objects based on the blueprint that we will setup.</p>
<p>The naming convention for the TypeScript class is:</p>
<code>COMPONENT_NAMEComponent</code>, where COMPONENT_NAME is the name of the component.
<p>This is a normal class and that is the reason we need to tell Angular that this is a special type of class, a <b>Component</b>. We can do this by adding <b>Decorators</b> which are a special feature which allows us to enhance our classes using elements. Components are always added by using <code>@Component</code> before the class. And, since this is also unknown to the class, we will need to <b>import</b> the file which will inform about these components from the <code>@angular/core</code>. We have used <code>@angular/core</code> because Angular shifts between a lot of packages where it, basically, groups its functionality and <code>core</code> gives us access to some of the core functionalities.</p>

<h2>Accessing the Server Component</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <h3>This is a container for the Server Component</h3>
            <hr>
            <app-server></app-server>
            <h3>End of Container for the Server Component</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<h2>Generating App Component using the Angular CLI</h2>
<p>In the CLI, we have the <code>generate</code> command to generate some elements supported by Angular. We can create a component using the <code>generate</code> command with the following syntax:</p>
<p><code>ng generate component NAME_OF_COMPONENT</code> OR <code>ng g c NAME_OF_COMPONENT</code></p>
<p>For example, we want to create a component named <code>servers</code>, then we can generate that as:</p>
<p><code>ng generate component servers</code></p>
<p>After using this command, we can see that there is another folder created named <code>servers</code> as shown in the below image:</p>
<img class="images" src="../../../../../../Images/2. The Basics/20. Creating Components with the CLI & Nesting Components/Image 1.png" alt="IMAGE NOT FOUND" />
<p>We have the content from the Angular CLI's Components as:</p>
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <h3>This is a container for the Server Component</h3>
            <hr>
            <!-- <app-servers></app-servers> -->
            <!-- <div app-servers></div> -->
            <div class="app-servers"></div>
            <h3>End of Container for the Server Component</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
