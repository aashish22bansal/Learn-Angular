<h4>Event Binding</h4>
<div class="container">
    <p>Suppose we wnat to allow the user to add servers by clicking on the Button below:</p>
    <button class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="!allowNewServer" (click)="onCreateServer()">Add Server</button>
    <p>{{ ServerCreationStatus }}</p>
    <p>But at this point, the button is just a static button is just a static button and it cannot do anything. So, we will add a new property in the TypeScript Code named allowNewServer as a boolean value. (Heading to TypeScript File to create the variable.)</p>
    <p>In the constructor we will define a Timeout() method which will trigger after the specified period of time. In the method body, we will set the allowNewServer to be set to <code>true</code> and then use the <code>disabled</code> HTML attribute within Square Brackets (<code>[]</code>) as <code>[disabled]</code> which would indicate that we are using <b>Property Binding</b> to dynamically bind some property and change it in the DOM for the parsed model and then pass the property name used in the TypeScript class as: <code>[disabled] = "!allowNewServer"</code>. This will exactly resolve to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> based on the property needs.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now, we have already created the Button. Say that we want to output the value of a Property (say we have a Property named ServerCreationStatus in the TypeScript File).</p>
    <p>Now, to listen to events, we can create another method in the TypeScript File (named <code>onCreateServer()</code>). This method will be called by some event(s).</p>
    <p>Now, we know that we want to listen to the click event generated by the Button (for which we have the onClick attribute in HTML as well). Now, in Angular, for Event Binding, we will use the syntax containing Parenthesis (<code>()</code>) and specify the name of the event within the Parenthesis as a <code>click</code> event and mention the code we want to execute within the Double Quotation marks which in our case is the <code>onCreateServer()</code> method.</p>
