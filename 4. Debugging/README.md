    <h1>Using Console in Developer Tools</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Sometimes when we do not get the desired output on the screen, then we can open the Console from the Developer Section and it can show us certain results or it can directly show us some of the run-time error which might be thrown either by the code or the browser.</p>
        <p>Now, the way the error messages are being shown in Angular have improved, so they give us a lot of useful information about where the error is located and why there is an error. With this information, we can go back to our code and check at that location and resolve the issue. It is not necessary that there is error only in that one particular location, the error might be caused by some other error leading to a chain reaction.</p>
