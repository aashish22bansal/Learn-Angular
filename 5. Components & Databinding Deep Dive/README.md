    <h2>Property & Event Binding</h2>
    <p>We should be able to send data into a component or receive data/event. Angular provides us with tools to implement this flow. We can use Property & Event Binding not only on HTML Elements and their native properties and events but we can also use them on Directives (for example, with ngClass and ngStyle) and Components and bind them to our own Custom Properties and Events. So, we can emit our own events.</p>
